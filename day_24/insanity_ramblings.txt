bit 2 (pgc is carry)

x02 and y02 -> nss
x02 XOR y02 -> fvj
pgc XOR fvj -> z02
pgc AND fvj -> qrm

nss OR qrm -> wdm

bit 3 (wdm is carry)


...


bit 5 (unknown carry)

x05 XOR y05 -> ffn
rdj XOR ffn -> z05              rdj should be the carry then
ffn AND fdj -> shc

x05 AND y05 -> bkk

shc OR bkk -> wvr               This is the carry-out.

given x05 = 1, y05 = 1, rdj = 0:
z05 = 0
wvr = 1

continue checking bit 6

x06 AND y06 -> bpp
x06 XOR y06 -> jgw
jgw AND wvr -> ghf
wvr XOR jgw -> fkp          shouldnt this be the output?
bpp OR ghf -> z06           what the fuck, this should be the carry-out

given wvr = 1, x06 = 0, y06 = 0:

when swapped is correct (z06 = 1), otherwise incorrect (fkp = 1 and then used in the next bit...)


bit 30 (unknown carry)

immediately obvious: z31 is wrong, its y31 AND x31 -> z31.

x30 xor y30 - qgd
x30 and y30 -> bpk
wrv xor qgd - z30
qgd and wrv - gqt       wrv is carry in
qgt or bbk - tpf        tpf is carry out



x31 xor y31 - mgq
x31 and z31 -> z31      wrong.
mgq xor tpf - mfm       sus, x31 xor y31 xor cin should be z31.
tkc or mfm - brs        brs is carry out
tpf and mgq - tkc       cin and xor result




bit 10 (unknown carry)

given rvw 0 , x10 1, y10 1

x10 xor y10 - dtb
y10 and x10 - qnf
rvw xor dtb -> z10    (rvw is carry)
sgv OR qnf - stv      (stv is carry out)
rvw AND dtb - sgv

dtb = 0, qnf = 1, z10 = 0, sgv = 0, stv = 1  (this seems correct, what about bit 11?)


given stv 1, x11 0, y11 0

x11 xor y11 -> jpp
y11 and x11 -> wmq
jpp xor stv -> ngr   (sus, shouldnt this be z11?)
stv and jpp -> z11  (what)
wmq or ngr -> knj   (carry out)


bit 38 (unknown carry)

given ntr 0, x38 1, y38 1

y38 and x38 - bpt    this is sus
y38 xor x38 - krj    this is sus
ntr xor bpt - z38
ntr and bpt - tdv
tdv or krj - hsp     hsp is carry out
